var translation = {
    // This document is to be used as a template as all the base code is in English
    // Basic HTML tags are allowed such as <b><i> etc. All data is sanitized https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML

    // When updating the template you must also update the en version. If you don't and a new language with a new setting is used, it
    // will NOT translate back after switching back to en

    // How to create a new language:
    //  1) Create a new folder in locale and copy the template, add the locale prefix (en, uwu, etc) to the start of the variable
    //          (var translation -> var en_translation) then edit the template with your new languages words.
    //  2) Go into the i18n.js and find `arrActiveLangs` and add the prefix to that array. ['en'] -> ['en', 'uwu']
    //  3) Go into the i18n.js page and find `translatableLanguages` add your prefix and variable name
    //              var translatableLanguages = {
    //                  "en": en_translation
    //              }
    //        Turns into:
    //              var translatableLanguages = {
    //                  "en": en_translation,
    //                  "uwu": uwu_translation
    //              }
    //  4) Submit a push request to the github

    // NOTE: If a section does NOT need translating, leave it empty.
